🎯 CodSoft Internship – Task 2
💬 Rule-Based Chatbot using Python

As part of Task 2 in my CodSoft Internship, I built a simple rule-based chatbot in Python that interacts with users using pattern recognition and conditional logic.

🔧 Tech Used: Python

🤖 Bot Type: Rule-Based (Regex + Conditional Logic)

🎯 Goal: Simulate human-like responses using basic NLP techniques

🧠 Key Concepts Learned:

1.Pattern Matching using re (Regular Expressions)

2.Interactive Command-Line Applications

3.Handling user input and dynamic responses

4.Date, Time, and Random modules in Python

👨‍💻 What the Chatbot Can Do:

-Responds to greetings and farewells

-Shares the current date and time

-Tells jokes

-Understands emotional expressions (happy/sad)

-Answers simple queries like “what can you do?”

-Exits politely when asked

📌 Output Example:

ChatBot: Hello! I'm a smarter chatbot. Ask me anything or type 'bye' to exit.
You: hello  
ChatBot: Hi there! How can I help you?  
You: tell me a joke  
ChatBot: Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!  
You: what is the time  
ChatBot: The current time is 03:47 PM

✅ A fun and practical way to explore the basics of AI-style interaction without any external libraries.
